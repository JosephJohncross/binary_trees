This repo involves working with binary tree data structure. A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Key Concepts/Operations:
- Traversals: Visiting each node in a tree in a specific order (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order).

- Insertion: Adding new nodes to the tree while maintaining its structure

- Deletion: Removing nodes from the tree while preserving its integrity.

- Searching: Finding specific nodes within the tree.
